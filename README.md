# 2D_simulation: 2D Marine Ecosystem Simulation

This project provides a computer simulation of a marine ecosystem in two dimensions (2D). Its aim is to model the complex interactions within a marine ecosystem, offering insights into its dynamics, biodiversity, and the impact of various factors on its balance.

## Objective

The main goal is to develop a tool to simulate and analyze interactions within a marine ecosystem, taking into account both theoretical and technical aspects.

## Background

Marine ecosystems play a vital role in the Earthâ€™s biosphere:
- Climate regulation
- Provision of food resources
- Preservation of biodiversity

This project is designed as both a scientific and educational tool to better understand these challenges through numerical simulation.

## Methodology

The project is structured around three main axes:

1. **Methodological Aspects**:  
   - Presents the foundations needed to understand the simulation.
   - Defines the main objectives and modeling assumptions.

2. **Theoretical Aspects**:  
   - Logical modeling of ecosystem components (species, interactions, environment).
   - Justifies modeling choices.

3. **Technical Aspects**:  
   - Software structure and implementation details in Python.
   - Description of code architecture and main modules.

## Features

- Simulation of the dynamics of different marine species in a 2D environment.
- Inclusion of biological interactions (predation, competition, reproduction, etc.).
- Visualization of evolving populations over time.
